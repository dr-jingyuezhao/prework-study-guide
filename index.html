            Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of
            margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and
            content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.
          </li>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assign the rule to a class attribute with a class selector, the
            period preceding card designates this as a class selector.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by
            semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a
            color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #, which you can find on this
            HTML Color Codes website.

        <ul>
          <li>
            A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data
            in our code.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web
            console by adding an argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can also open Chrome DevTools using keyboard commands. If using
            macOS, press Command+Option+I, and if using windows, press
            Control+Shift+I.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and order counts.</li>
          <li>
            We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in
            which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.
          </li>
          <li>
            In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition by using else if.
          </li>
          <li>
            The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are
            equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and
            false if the values are not equal.
          </li>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
            Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.
          </li>
          <li>
            In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are
            zero-indexed and sequential.
          </li>
          <li>
            A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task
            on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be
            executed over and over.
          </li>
          <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1.</li>
          <li>
            Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in
            case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript
            code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.
          </li>
          <li>
            A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer
            how to perform a certain task.
          </li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
          <li>
            To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our
            function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly
            brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.
          </li>
          <li>
            Type the name of the function in the console to call the function.
          </li>
          <li>
            To randomize our selection, we need to use a special Math function
            that helps us select a random number.
          </li>
          <li>
            Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's
            built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random
            number. To learn more about the Math object properties and methods,
            visit the MDN Web Docs on Math.
